# Gotchas

Hard-won lessons. Read before making changes to coordinate mapping, 3D preview, or Docker.

## Y-axis inversion

SVG/layout/bin-space is Y-down (0 = top edge). build123d is Y-up. Always negate Y when mapping: `-(y + offset_y)`.

- Flipping Y reverses polygon winding -- remove any `reversed()` calls if adding a Y-flip
- Text labels use a flipped Plane (z_dir down) so they negate Y separately
- BinPreview3D.tsx: rotation `[-PI/2, 0, 0]` converts Z-up to Y-up. Do NOT add `scale [1, -1, 1]` -- that was a compensating hack for un-flipped Y
- All three must match: layout editor, 3D preview, downloaded STL in slicer

## Three.js memory leaks

Every `BufferGeometry` and `EdgesGeometry` must be `.dispose()`d on React unmount. STL regeneration creates new geometries each time -- if the old ones aren't disposed, the browser will OOM. Same applies to `Image` objects created in useEffect (use a `cancelled` flag in cleanup).

## Docker

Single container runs both frontend and backend via supervisor. Key details:

- CORS origins in `backend/.env` override the Python defaults -- if you change the frontend port, update `.env` too
- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` is set in the Dockerfile build stage
- `.dockerignore` excludes `docs/`, `node_modules/`, `venv/`, `storage/`, `.claude/`

## OCCT / build123d performance

Boolean operations (add, subtract) are single-threaded in OCCT. More cores don't help. Polygon cutouts are batched into a single sketch + single extrude to minimise the number of booleans. Apple Silicon is ~7x faster single-thread than EPYC 7402 for these operations.

## Frontend patterns

- Shared constants (`DISPLAY_SCALE`, `SNAP_GRID`, `GRID_UNIT`, etc.) live in `lib/constants.ts`
- `DISPLAY_SCALE = 8` converts mm to SVG units in the bin editor
- Config is spread into the API request body: `{ ...config, polygons }` in `generateStl`
- Text labels live on BinConfig (not Polygon) since they're free-placed
- PolygonEditor uses refs (`polygonsRef`, `onPolygonsChangeRef`) to avoid stale closures during drag -- do not add `polygons` or `onPolygonsChange` to the `handleMouseMove` dependency array
- Auto-save uses the `useDebouncedSave` hook (debounce + `beforeunload` flush). Pass `skipInitial: true` to avoid saving on first load.
- Undo/redo uses the `useHistory` hook (deep-clone, Cmd+Z handling). The `set()` method pushes to history; `undo()`/`redo()` call the `onChange` callback.
- ToolEditor and BinEditor are split into orchestrator + toolbar + canvas sub-components. `CutoutOverlay` renders finger holes in both.

## Paper corner detection

Uses a two-stage approach: U2-Net Portable generates a rough tool mask (~0.17s), tool pixels are blacked out, then OpenCV brightness thresholding finds the paper rectangle in the cleaned image. This prevents tools (especially dark ones on white paper) from fragmenting the paper region during detection.

The brightness detection tries multiple thresholds (200, 190, 180), picks the largest valid candidate, and validates against aspect ratio (0.55-0.85, covering A4 and Letter) and fill ratio (>35% of the bounding rectangle is bright). A convex hull merge step handles cases where the paper is split into fragments.

Difficult cases: hands in the frame, sticks/rods crossing the paper, very heavy tool overflow with minimal visible paper. These may need manual corner adjustment.

## Gemini mask quirks

- Masks come back at different dimensions AND aspect ratio than requested. `_trace_mask()` resizes with `INTER_NEAREST`, then `_align_mask()` uses template matching to correct the positional offset.
- `_align_mask()` extracts the tool region from the resized mask, searches for it in the inverted corrected image via `cv2.matchTemplate(TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)`, and applies a translation. Runs at 0.25x resolution (~20ms). Skipped if score < 0.15 or shift > 10% of image dimension.
- `_trace_mask()` handles both alpha-channel PNGs (tool=opaque, bg=transparent) and RGB PNGs (tool=black, bg=white).
- The prompt asks for a "stencil" -- flat black shapes on flat white. This works better than asking for a "mask" with `gemini-2.5-flash-image`.
