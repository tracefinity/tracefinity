# Closed-item scope precedent audit

This audit checks the product constitution against decisions Jason has already
made in public. It deliberately uses **closed issues and closed pull requests
only**. No currently open request is treated as precedent, even when an open
request was discussed while the constitution was being drafted.

This is supporting evidence, not a second source of product policy.
[`CONSTITUTION.md`](../CONSTITUTION.md) remains the canonical guide.

Audit date: 2026-08-23. Repository: [tracefinity/tracefinity](https://github.com/tracefinity/tracefinity).

## Method and coverage

The authenticated GitHub account and repository administrator was confirmed as
[`jasonmadigan`](https://github.com/jasonmadigan). The audit then paginated the
complete closed-issue and closed-pull-request sets through the GitHub API. It
screened ordinary conversation comments, formal pull-request reviews, inline
review comments, and maintainer-authored bodies where a merge or closure needed
that context.

| Surface | Closed items or maintainer-authored material screened |
|-|-:|
| Closed issues (pull requests excluded) | 69 |
| Closed pull requests | 104 |
| Ordinary comments on closed issues | 43 |
| Ordinary comments on closed pull requests | 41 |
| Formal reviews on closed pull requests | 56 (35 with a non-empty body) |
| Inline review comments on closed pull requests | 57 |
| Closed issue bodies authored by the maintainer | 28 |
| Closed pull requests authored by the maintainer | 51 |

All 69 closed issues currently have GitHub's `COMPLETED` state reason. That
includes requests whose proposed mechanism was redirected or declined. The
constitution's `Not planned` reason and scope/status labels are therefore a new,
prospective bookkeeping policy, not a description of how old decisions were
recorded.

The tables below omit thanks, scheduling, merge logistics, routine debugging,
copy edits, and ordinary line-level defects that do not establish a reusable
product or contribution principle. Multiple comments from one review are
grouped when they express one rationale; every linked item was closed at the
audit cutoff.

| [#56: backup and restore](https://github.com/tracefinity/tracefinity/pull/56) | [Product decision](https://github.com/tracefinity/tracefinity/pull/56#issuecomment-4702507666), [safety review](https://github.com/tracefinity/tracefinity/pull/56#pullrequestreview-4419361128) | Plain-file copying and documentation solved the user need without new APIs and state.

## Themes already captured in the constitution

The current `CONSTITUTION.md` agrees with the closed history on the major
product decisions:

- **One photo-to-Gridfinity product, not a general converter.** PRs #72 and
  #134 directly establish the output and input boundaries. PR #45 shows that
  drawer and multi-bin planning can complete the same job rather than create a
  second product.
- **Compatible Gridfinity extensions are welcome.** Issue #101 and merged PR
  #112 support half-grid and partial-cell variants while their reviews insist
  on valid geometry and ecosystem interoperability.
- **Self-hosting is a complete path, not a universal hardware promise.** Issues
  #84, #87, and #88, PRs #38, #79, #93, and #124, and the local model work all
  support plain resource requirements, graceful degradation, and safe defaults.
- **Capabilities outrank provider brands.** Issues #11, #21, and #96 and PRs
  #51, #77, and #146 support capability adapters, technically suitable model
  classes, optional remote providers, transit disclosure, and licensing as a
  selection criterion.
- **Users must be able to see and correct consequential results.** The current
  early-warning, partial-failure, and preview/export language is strongly
  supported by issues #98, #107, #118, #121, #150, #184, #185, and #186.
- **Security, accessibility, deployment, data safety, and maintainability have
  their own route into scope.** Issues #50, #63, #66, #125, and #189 and PRs
  #69, #79, #111, and #179 show that these do not need feature-demand evidence.
- **Scope and implementation quality are separate.** PRs #53, #54, #112,
  #127, #135, and #136 concern aligned features whose submitted shape still
  needed to become focused, safe, compatible, and verifiable.
- **Use the smallest adequate mechanism.** Issue #81 and the #56/#82 backup
  sequence support configuration or documentation when new application state
  is unnecessary.
- **Direction can change with evidence.** PR #134 expressly left room to
  reconsider if demand emerged, and issue #21 shows defaults changing after
  measurement. Neither says that demand automatically overrides a boundary.

The branch's updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `DESIGN.md` also correctly keep
several repeated engineering precedents out of the product constitution:
focused PRs, honest `Closes` semantics, changed-behaviour tests, atomic data
replacement, preservation of corrupt files, safe configuration defaults, and
provider adapters are implementation and contribution rules rather than new
product modes.

## Changes made after the audit

The review found two small data-lifecycle ambiguities, both now addressed in the
constitution.

### 1. Make deletion non-resurrection explicit

The current data paragraph prevents silent discard or overwrite, but issues
#156 and #160 establish a different invariant: once a user deletes data, stale
caches and in-flight work must not recreate it.

The constitution now says that a deletion must stay deleted and stale state or
in-flight saves must not bring the data back.

### 2. Clarify what fulfils the data-export promise

“Users ... must be able to export” could be read as promising an application
API or button, while the closed #56/#82 decision deliberately chose documented
plain-file copying. The outcome is practical portability, not a mandated UI.

The constitution now says that a dependable, documented operation on the
plain-file storage can meet the need without dedicated application screens or
APIs.

### Precedent-link precision

This was a citation improvement rather than a policy change. The partial-bin
issue #106 is closed but contains no maintainer-authored rationale. In the
precedent table, the implemented and reviewed closed PR #112 now replaces issue
#106. The #72, #134, #56, and #11 entries now land directly on their decisive
comments.

## Contradictions, changed positions, and caveats

- **The proposed GitHub taxonomy is new.** Old declined or redirected issues
  #11, #81, and #96 are all closed as `Completed`. Calling them `NOT A PRODUCT
  FEATURE as proposed` is a useful retrospective constitutional classification,
  not a label that existed when Jason closed them.
- **Corrupt-data handling became stricter.** PR #67 distinguished unreadable
  storage from corrupt JSON but still tolerated some corrupt-data resets. The
  later #53 review asked that long-lived corrupt station data be preserved, and
  the current design rules adopt that safer position. This is an evolved rule,
  not an unresolved constitutional conflict.
- **Specific model defaults have changed.** Issue #21 records a historical
  preferred local model, while later resource and provider work changed the
  available/default set. That is consistent with capability-over-brand and
  evidence-based defaults; the constitution should not freeze a model name.
- **Demand mechanics are more formal than the history.** PR #134 supports
  reconsideration when demand appears, but the exact reactions/comments/
  duplicates workflow in the constitution is a new operating convention. It is
  compatible with precedent, not derived from an old threshold.

## Bottom line

The constitution is faithful to the maintainer's closed-item record. Its central
boundaries are not newly invented: #72 and #134 state them directly, and the
accepted work consistently deepens the same photo-to-Gridfinity job. The main
historical material missing from the first draft—physical fidelity, visible
partial failure, realistic self-hosting requirements, and contribution safety—
is now present across the constitution, design principles, and contribution
guide. The two data-lifecycle clarifications above close the remaining
ambiguities without widening the product.
